    <p>Hi guys!</p>
    
    <p>Welcome to the Malaysia in Melbourne app! As a former international student in Melbourne myself, I know what it&rsquo;s like to be far away from home and in a foreign land. Having said that however, the City of Melbourne is an AMAZING place to discover yourself and more importantly to re-invent yourself! In my opinion, Melbourne is one of the BEST places in the world to choose as a study destination as not only does it offer extremely prestigious higher institutions of study, it also offers you an entire package of life experiences! You&rsquo;ll meet some of the nicest people, drink the best coffees on Degraves St, enjoy the sweetest gelatos on Lygon St, experience the best nightlife with some of the wackiest people you&rsquo;d ever meet on Brunswick St and the list just goes on and on! </p>
    
    <p>Nevertheless, as a Malaysian, I know how much our food, our culture and our fellow Malaysians mean to us. With all this in mind I&rsquo;ve created the Malaysia in Melbourne app, which I hope will serve as a &ldquo;home away from home&rdquo; guide to you right here in the City of Melbourne. For now, the Malaysia in Melbourne app will feature Malaysian restaurants, places where you can buy Asian groceries, a list of Halal butchers and a section where you can get help. I have also put together some video footage especially for those that are still contemplating their move to study in Melbourne. I hope that these videos and information will offer some sort of reassurance and comfort to you that this wonderful City of Melbourne also offers you a bit of Malaysia as well! This app is the first of its kind and is to be a &ldquo;growing&rdquo; app with regular updates put in along the way. Please feel free to contact me if you have any ideas/information/input about what else you&rsquo;d like to see in the Malaysia in Melbourne app. So in other words, this app is YOUR app and I hope to tailor make it to suit the needs of all Malaysian students here in Melbourne.</p>
    
    <p>Last but not least, YOU ARE IN THE AMAZING CITY OF MELBOURNE&#8230; or at least planning on coming here! My advice to you is to make the MOST of your time here, to study hard of course but also not to forget to make an effort to get to know the friendly local Melbournians as well as to take some time off to explore and enjoy being in Melbourne. HOT TIP: Invite a local Melbournian to one of the Malaysian restaurants featured in this Malaysia in Melbourne app and share our delicious and mouthwatering food with them! </p>
    
    <p>I would like to thank >>>></p>
    
    <p>Cheers!</p>
