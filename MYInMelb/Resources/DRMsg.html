    <p>To all fellow Malaysians,</p>
    
    <p>I would like to wish all of you a very warm welcome to this vibrant and cosmopolitan City of Melbourne! I would also like to assure all of you that even though you are about 8 hours away from home, you can be rest assured that the Malaysian Consulate General in Melbourne will always have its doors open to you. Please remember to make it a point to register with us once you&rsquo;re in Melbourne.</p>
    
    <p>Our fellow Malaysian Juliet John has created the Malaysia in Melbourne app with YOU in mind. Juliet was once a former international student in Melbourne and knows what it is like to be far away from home. This app is a great initiative and also a wonderful tool for all Malaysians in general that come to Melbourne. Please feel free to contact Juliet John if you have any queries or would like your business/organization to be featured in this app.</p>
    
    <p>So do check out the Malaysia in Melbourne app whilst you are here in Melbourne and I wish you all the best very best in your future endeavors. </p>
    
    <p>Sincerely,</p>
