The PappaRich Group
		
PappaRich Group was established in 2005 with its 1st outlet in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Today, PappaRich has grown extensively and with a total of 50 outlets in Malaysia and continuously growing rapidly internationally. We are emerging as a formidable player in the local and international food and beverage industry.
With three new outlets in Australia â€“ QV, Doncaster and Chadstone, the PappaRich Group is now embarking on further international expansion to places such as Singapore (launched in September 2012), Indonesia and greater China to name a few.
The popularity of PappaRich internationally, is attributed largely to the introduction of its high quality food offerings such as freshly-made roti canai, traditional Hainan bread with kaya and butter, satay, nasi lemak, fried kuey teow, curry laksa, assam laksa, chicken rice, prawn mee, mee goreng, ice kacang and many more!
We only use high quality ingredients to bring out the best in Malaysian Delights. Beside a wide range of delicious food, we have also created more  than 60 types of beverages, from PappaRich range of specially blended local coffee and tea to organic soya milk and juices.
With our open concept, you are able to see the Pappa white coffee, roti canai being prepared on the spot, adding a whole new dimension to your dining experience.
Our outlets are decorated in earthy colours to give a cozy, clean and comfortable ambience that suit the needs of those who want either a quick bite or a relaxing leisurely meal.

PappaRich Australia 

PappaRich Australia, a joint-venture with PappaRich Malaysia, opened its first outlets in QV, Doncaster and Chadstone in March, April and May 2012 respectively. Saw Tatt Ghee, Head of the Australian operations found the need for a truly authentic Malaysian home cuisine in Australia. This opportunity serves well within the growing Asian community.

Our Future Plans

Looking forward, we continue to seek strategic opportunities for building our core business and activities. This also means a continued investment of resources and money to improve our human capital, production process and product quality.
With current outlets in QV, Doncaster and Chadstone, an outlet in Nunawading is also in the pipeline with other states to follow.
PappaRich aspires to provide good Malaysian food all over the world.
